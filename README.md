# Project-First-Class-Interior-Agile-Scrum
I am working on a project at a software development company called "Smith private Limited". My company produces web solutions for businesses and individuals throughout New Zealand. The company got a contract from the “First Class Interiors” Auckland based company. This company is famous for its high-quality interior design solutions for all kinds of premises like houses, restaurants, schools, offices, casinos, and many more. First Class Interiors company is looking for a website which should be more interactive and user friendly. The target of the company is to promote their business country-wide so that they could earn more benefits. I must use the Agile Scrum Methodology to create Project Backlog, Plan and execute sprints and release the project to Github and then deploy it to Azure.
